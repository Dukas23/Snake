# Snake game - Implementing BFS in Snake with Pygame

## Description

This project combines the classic Snake game with the implementation of the BFS (Breadth-First Search) search algorithm.

The game is developed in Python using Pygame for the graphical interface. The goal is to show how search algorithms can be applied to practical situations, such as controlling the movement of a snake in a game.
